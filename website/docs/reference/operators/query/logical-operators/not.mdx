# `$not`

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Dataset from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/2-insert-dataset.request.js';
import NotOperatorRequest from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/5-not-operator.request.js';
import NotOperatorResponse from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/5-not-operator.response.js';

The `$not` operator negates a query expression and returns documents that do not match it.

The operator accepts a single query expression as shown below, and all documents that do not match the expression are included in the result set.

```js
db.runCommand({
  find: '<collection_name>',
  filter: {
    rating: {
      $not: { <query_expression> }
    }
  }
})
```

A query expression for the `$not` operator must be combined with another operator or a regular expression, such as:

- `{ <field>: { <operator>: <value> } }`
- `{ <field>: /<pattern>/ }`

It cannot be used with direct values or as a top-level operator.

## Example

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `$not` operator in queries using documents in the following `books` collection:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<CodeBlock language="js">{Dataset}</CodeBlock>

### Filter documents that do not match a specific expression

Using the books collection, return all documents where the rating is not less than `4.5`.

<CodeBlock language="js">{NotOperatorRequest}</CodeBlock>

The `$not` operator negates the query expression, so it returns all documents where the rating is not less than `4.5`.
In this case, it returns `pride_prejudice_1813` and `clean_code_2008`.

<CodeBlock language="js">{NotOperatorResponse}</CodeBlock>

### Implementation notes and constraints

- The `$not` operator cannot be used directly as a top-level operator independently and must be used to negate another operator like `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc., or a regular expression.
- It matches all documents that do not satisfy the specified condition, even if the field is missing or null.

## Additional information

Please find other logical operators in the following sections:

- [`$or`](./or.mdx)
- [`$and`](./and.mdx)
- [`$nor`](./nor.mdx)
