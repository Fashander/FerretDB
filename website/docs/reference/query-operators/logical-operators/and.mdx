# `$and` Operator

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Dataset from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/2-insert-dataset.request.js';
import AndOperatorRequest from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/3-and-operator.request.js';
import AndOperatorResponse from '!!raw-loader!./logical-operators/3-and-operator.response.js';

The `$and` operator combines multiple query expressions and returns documents that match all the expressions.

The operator accepts an array of query expressions as shown below, and all expressions must be satisfied for a document to be included in the result set.

```js
db.runCommand({
  find: '<collection_name>',
  filter: {
    $and: [
      { <query-expression1> },
      { <query-expression2> }
    ]
  }
})
```

A query expression can be any valid query such as `{ <field>: <value> }`, `{ <field>: { <operator>: <value> } }`, `{ <field>: /<pattern>/ }`, etc.

## Example

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `$and` operator in queries using documents in the following `books` collection:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<CodeBlock language="js">{Dataset}</CodeBlock>

### Filter documents with multiple query expressions

Using the `books` collection, return all documents where the author is `British` AND rating is greater or equal to 4.5.

<CodeBlock language="js">{AndOperatorRequest}</CodeBlock>

The AND operation returns `pride_prejudice_1813` as the document that matches both expressions.

<CodeBlock language="js">{AndOperatorResponse}</CodeBlock>

Even though `clean_code_2008` matches the second query expression in the earlier example, it is not returned since it does not match the first one.

## Implementation notes and constraints

- The `$and` operator cannot be used directly as a top-level aggregation stage; it must be used within a query context like `$match`.
- For array fields, ensure that the query expressions are structured to match the elements within the array, or use `$elemMatch` for more complex queries.

## Additional information

Please find other logical operators in the following sections:

- [`$not`](./not.mdx)
- [`$nor`](./nor.mdx)
