# Time-To-Live (TTL) indexes

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import CreateIndex from '!!raw-loader!./requests/1-create-ttl-index.js';
import InsertTTLData from '!!raw-loader!./requests/2-insert-ttl-data.js';

TTL (Time-To-Live) indexes are useful when you need documents to expire automatically after a certain time. It's ideal for temporary records, logs, or session data.
They are single-field indexes and not allowed as multi-field/compound indexes.

:::note

- Documents inserted before the index was created may not be affected until an insert or update operation occurs. It is recommended to create the TTL index before inserting documents.
- The cleanup of expired documents is a background operation that runs every 60 seconds, so deletion may not be immediate.

## Creating a TTL index

A TTL index is created using the `createIndex` command with the field you want to index and the `expireAfterSeconds`.
The field must be a `Date` type.
The `expireAfterSeconds` option indicates the number of seconds before a document expires.

For example, to create a TTL index on a `publication.date` field in a `books` collection:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<CodeBlock language="js">{CreateIndex}</CodeBlock>

Let's insert a document into the `books` collection:

<CodeBlock language="js">{InsertTTLData}</CodeBlock>

After 10 seconds, the document will expire and be queued for deletion during the next cleanup operation.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
